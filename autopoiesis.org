* TODO Introduction

The model presented by Varela, Maturana, and Urbie[fn:1] demonstrates an
autopeietical organization that constructs and maintains a membrane
surrounding a catalyst.

I implemented the model using [[https://www.rust-lang.org][Rust]], since I have been wanting to learn
more about the language. The source code is available [[https://github.com/wfvining/autopoiesis][here]].

* TODO The Model
The wold for the model is an infinite two dimensional grid filled
completely with substrate elements. Distributed throughout the world
are /catalyst/ elements that react with the substrate to form
/links/. Reactions that form links consume two substrate elements,
leaving behind a /hole/ in addition to the newly formed link.

* TODO Making it asynchronous
* TODO Results
#+CAPTION: If catalysts (red) and holes (black) cannot pass through bonded links (pink and white for single- and double-bonded respectively), this is the result. Five catalysts are shown, none of which have established a closed membrane
