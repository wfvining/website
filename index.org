I am a Ph.D. student in the biological computation lab under
Dr. Melanie Moses where I work in support of the [[http://nasaswarmathon.com][NASA Swarmathon]]. My
current research investigates situated auditory communication in a
robot swarm. More generally I am interested in situated communincation
for robots, cognition, language, distributed systems and models of
computation.

I received my bachelors degree in computer science from UNM
in 2016. Following that I worked at Los Alamos National Laboratory in
the High Performance Computing division. My primary work at LANL was
on a peta-scale file system project called [[https://github.com/mar-file-system/marfs][MarFS]] which was was an
[[https://rd100conference.com][R&D100 award]] finalist in 2016.

Most of the software I write is avaiable on [[https://github.com/wfvining][github]]. A few hilights are
- A distributed, eventually consistent, implementation of [[https://github.com/wfvining/Meridian][MAPElites]]
- my [[https://github.com/wfvining/emacs-stuff][emacs configuration]] which includes a beautiful [[file:img/wfv-color-theme.png][color scheme]] I
  have crafted of the last five or six years.
- An asynchronous version of the [[https://github.com/wfvining/autopoeisis][model of autopoiesis]] presented by
  Varela, Maturana, and Uribe written in Rust. (Some incomplete
  writing about this model can be found [[file:autopoiesis.org][here]]).
